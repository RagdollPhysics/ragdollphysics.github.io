    <p>This one is somewhat functional. (yay?)</p>
    <p>ZoneBuilder is aimed at being a fully functional fastfile creator for IW4.  It currently supports xanims, xmodels, materials, and rawfiles with clipMap support on the way as well as weapons and sounds as soon as I get around to it. With the new aIW3 I am currently working on this one and will be for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <div class="project-content">
    <p>A small modification to the T4 client in order to aid modders who were hitting asset limits, memory limits, etc.  IT also adds some features like a full FOV slider and borderless windowed mode.</p>

<div class="header3 align-center">Assorted IW5M (InfinityScript) Mods</div>
<div class="project-content">
    <p>I have written a large ammount of code for IW5M that hasn't gotten released or got scrubbed from the forums recently.
    Starting with QCZM, the mod I have spent so much freaking time working on.  And litereally no one plays it.... oh well asshats. </p>
    <p>IW5GSC was another one that emulated GSC under InfinityScript but, again, no one used It so I stopped dev on it.
        GSCCompiler is the result of IW5GSC and compiles GSC to InfinityScript compatable CIL (.net code) but never got to a point where it was usable.</p>

<div class="project-content">
    I've been working on this one in some form or another for about 3 years now.  Haven't gotten anything even close to playable yet but it still just sits there taunting me. I don't have any screenshots because nothing really works as of right now.  It is written in C# using OpenTK as the graphics base.  It has a fully working filesystem and asset caching system that is just sitting there... Really useful right?</p>
